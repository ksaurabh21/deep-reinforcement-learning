# Project 2: Continuous Control

### Introduction

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  the agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

### Setup

To setup the environment, follow the instructions here: https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies


1. Download the environment from one of the links below.  You need only select the environment that matches your operating system:

    - **_Version 1: One (1) Agent_**
        - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Linux.zip)
        - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher.app.zip)
        - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86.zip)
        - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P2/Reacher/one_agent/Reacher_Windows_x86_64.zip)


Then get the Continuous_Control.ipynb, ddpg_agent.py and model.py from this repository and place it in p2_continuous-control folder.

### Instructions

Once the above setup is done, then open a command prompt, go to p2_continuous-control folder and launch a jupyter notebook.
Before running code in a notebook, change the kernel to match the drlnd environment by using the drop-down Kernel menu.
